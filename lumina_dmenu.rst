dmenu on lumina
================

I was searching for a way to open programs from the Keyboard in the Lumina Desktop. I had used dmenu in spectrwm and was basically looking for a replacement. 
Searching around the net I found a few snippets on how to get it to run. (found it `here <https://urukrama.wordpress.com/2008/02/07/using-dmenu-in-pekwm-and-openbox/>`_ )

.. code:: bash

	$ dmenu_path | dmenu -b 

This worked from the command line but it wouldn't execute the commands that it found. The -b also puts it at the bottom of the screen. I like it on the top of the screen.
