Tmux Setup on Spectrwm and FreeBSD
***********************************


tmux
=======


Tmux is a terminal multiplexer similar to gnu screen. It is in the base system for `OpenBSD <http://www.openbsd.org>`_ and is available as a port/package in `FreeBSD <http://www.freebsd.org>`_ . It allows for multiple terminals in a single window. Detaching or reattaching to a shell, and many many more. I use it to primarily get back to where I "was" the last time I log into my file server. I Have to travel between building some and I may be in the middle of something and I want that to continue. I have putty set to start tmux or reattach to a session if there is one currently started when I fire up a ssh connection to the file server.
